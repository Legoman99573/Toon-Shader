# Toon-Shader
Toon Shader made with Amplify Shader Editor

This was taken from some tutorials and mixed up for multiple uses. Can be used as a toon or standard shader. If toon is used, you can setup the fallback options as it falls back to standard shader.

You can add to the VRChat Creator Companion by going to ``Settings > Packages > Add Repository`` and just adding ``https://world.ugandavrc.com/index.json``

## Notes
* If you see something weird with transparency, just set it to AlphaTest and it should fix it.
* AudioLink Minimal package is required before adding this repo. Get it from here: https://github.com/llealloo/vrc-udon-audio-link
